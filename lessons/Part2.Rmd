## Learning Objectives

Welcome to Part 2 of the R Fundamentals series. Our goals for today's workshop are:

1.  Recall what a vector is and define a data frame

2.  Use read.csv to import data

3.  Use functions from the `tidyverse` package to subset variables in a data frame

Throughout this workshop series, we will use the following icons:

🔔 **Question**: A quick question to help you understand what's going on.

🥊 **Challenge**: Interactive exercise. We'll go through these in the workshop!

⚠️ **Warning**: Heads-up about tricky stuff or common mistakes.

💡 **Tip**: How to do something a bit more efficiently or effectively.

📝 **Poll**: A zoom poll to help you learn.

🎬 **Demo**: Showing off something more advanced so you know what you can use R for in the future

## Vector recap

In Part 1 we learned how to create vectors using the `c()` function.

```{r}
# create a vector storing 5 year from 2018 to 2022
years <- c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)
```

We can also use the `seq()` function to create vectors.

```{r}
# look at the seq() help page
?seq
seq(2018, 2022)

```

📝 **Poll RFun 2-1:** Looking at the seq() help page, which code is correct for creating a vector with the years 2018 to 2022? Try out the code below and answer in the Zoom poll.

```{r}

# try using seq() to create the same vector as above, called years_v2
years_v2 <- ...

```

### 🥊Challenge 1: Another way to create vectors

A third way to create a vector is using the `:` operator (colon operator). Look up the help page with `?colon` or Google how to use it (sometimes help pages are less helpful). Create a vector called `years_v3` that is the years 2018 to 2022 using the `:` operator.

Check that the three vectors we've created are the same length.

```{r}

years_v3 <- ...


```

💡 It's okay to try out functions and operators and get things wrong! Interpreting error messages and debugging code is the bread and butter of coding.

## Data frames

**Vectors** are variables that store multiple values of the same type (all numbers or all words). Most of the time, we want to work with data that have multiple variables - we call this **multidimensional data**. In R, we use **data frames** to store multidimensional data.

In R language, a data frame is an object containing multiple vectors of the same length. The values in a given vector are all the same type, but the vectors may each hold a different type of value. In everyday language, a data frame is a collection of variables (columns). Each variable contains the same number of observations (rows).

### 🥊Challenge 2: Your own data

Think of an example of data you have worked with. What are the observations (the unit of measurement)? What are the variables (the information being measured)? **Write your answer in the chat, but don't hit send until I say go...**

⚠️Data frames are not the only way to store multidimensional data in R - but they are the most common and easiest to work with.

## Import data

You can create a data frame in R and fill it with values. Normally though, you **import** data and save it as a data frame. You can import many different types of files into R (eg. excel sheets, csv files, dta files). Today we will import a csv file.

📝 **Poll RFun 2-2:** What file type does the data you work with usually come in?

```{r}
# import csv file 
gap <- read.csv("gapminder.csv")

```

🔔 The code above returned an error - why do you think this is?

When we read in data, we need to specify the **relative file path**. This means, from our **current working directory**, how do we get to the file we want to import.

```{r}
# print out our current working directory
getwd()

# read in gap data using a relative file path
gap <- read.csv("../data/gapminder.csv")

```

💡Within a file path, a period "." means "in this directory". A double period ".." means "go back one directory".

⚠️In R Notebooks, the working directory is always the directory in which the notebook is saved in - so all data needs to be read in relative to that directory. In R Scripts, you can change the working directory at the start of your script by using the `setwd()` function.

After importing data, the first thing to check is if the data looks like you expected it to.

```{r}
# examine our data
head(gap)
```

### 🥊Challenge 3: Import a csv file and explore the data

Clear the global environment (hint: if you can't remember the function to do this, you can use the broom icon). Read in the Gapminder data saved in the Data directory and save it to an object called **gap**.

Then use the functions `head()`, `dim()`, and `View()` (note the capital V) to answer the following questions:

1.  How many variables are there?

2.  How many observations are there?

3.  What information is in this data?

```{r}
# clear the global environment



# read in the gapminder data and save as an object called "gap"



# use the functions head(), dim(), and View() 
# eg. head(gap)



```

💡Often times different file types have different functions for importing them. To import a specific file type, Google what package and function is needed. Common packages for less common file types are `foreign` and `haven`.

## Classes of data

When we created variables in Part 1, we said that all the values in the variable needed to be the same type or **class**. Let's explore the variables in the gap data frame a bit more. We can select individual variables using the `$` operator.

```{r}
# select population 
gap$pop

# if you type gap$ it will show you a list of variables
# if you start typing one and hit "tab" it will tab complete for you
gap
```

The variables in our data frame have different classes. Lets use the `class()` operator to see this.

```{r}
# use the class() function to check the class of population
class(gap$pop)

# now country 
class(gap$country)
```

🔔 Why is the class of `pop` **numeric** and the class of `country` is **character**?

```{r}
# check if all numeric-looking variables have the same class
class(gap$year)
```

🔔 Why do you think `year` has class **integer** but `pop` has class **numeric**?

Overall there are five classes of data:

1.  **numeric**: decimals (the default for ALL numbers in R)

2.  **integer**: whole numbers (positive and negative, including zero)

3.  **character**: text strings (always wrapped in quotations)

4.  **logical**: TRUE or FALSE (1 or 0)

5.  **factor**: nominal or ordinal categorical type

⚠️ We have learned the first three classes. We will encounter **logicals** and **factors** later in the series.

📝 **Poll RFun 2-3**: Use the function `class()` on each of the following variables and match them with their class: `continent`, `lifeExp`, `gdpPercap`, `year`

```{r}

class(...)


```

## Subsetting data frames

We often want to work with **subsets** of our data. A subset is a portion or slice of our data. It could be a subset of rows, for example, if we wanted to see all rows for the country Argentina. It could also be a subset of columns, for example, if we wanted to see only population and year. It could also be a combination of rows and columns. We do this by **indexing**.

Indexing refers to specifying the rows or columns that we want to extract from an object. It is done using **square brackets**. For a single vector, we extract a specific element by providing the index of that value (index means its place in the vector).

```{r}
# create a vector with years from 2000 to 2010 in 
years <- 2000:2010
years

# extract the 5th element of that vector
years[5]

# extract the 12th element of that vector - what happens?
years[12]
```

Because data frames are two dimensional, we need to specify the rows and the columns we want. The format is always: **data.frame[rows, columns]**. By leaving either rows or columns blank, that selects all of them.

```{r}
# extract a single variable using the indexing method - note the rows index is empty so it will return all rows 
gap[ , "pop"]

```

We can index **multiple** columns. This is done by providing a vector of variable names inside the square brackets.

```{r}
# extract multiple variables using the indexing method
gap[ , c("pop", "year")]

# we can also define the vector of names first
variables <- c("pop" , "year", "lifeExp")
gap[ , variables]
```

### 🥊Challenge 4: Subsetting columns

Extract three variables of your choice from the gap data frame. Thinking back to Part 1 when we learned the assignment operator `<-`. See if you can assign these three extracted variables to a new data frame called **gap_subset**.

```{r}




```

### Tidyverse subsetting

We just leaned how to subset columns in **base R**. Base R refers to all the functions and operators that you can use in R without installing any additional packages. Base R will get you a long way in data science. However, it is not always the easiest code to read and interpret. A common package that people use to perform data science in R is `tidyverse`. The `tidyverse` package includes functions that are designed to be more intuitive for doing data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

Before we use functions from `tidyverse`. We need to take two steps:

1.  **Install** the package - you only need to do this once on your computer.

2.  **Load** the package into R - you need to do this every time you open a new R session.

💡These steps are the same for every package you download in R.

```{r}
# install the tidyverse package - note the name of the package needs to be in quotes
install.packages("tidyverse")

# load the package into the current R session - note the name of the package doesn't need to be in quotes (!) and you can use tab complete to see a list of installed packages
library(tidyverse)

# check that tidyverse has been loaded
?tidyverse
```

Now we have installed and loaded tidyverse, we can use its `select` function to subset variables.

```{r}

# look up the documentation for select - focus on the Arguments section
?select

# select year, pop, and lifeExp from the dataset 
select(gap, year, pop, lifeExp)

# assign these variables to a new dataset
gap_subset <- select(gap, year, pop, lifeExp)
dim(gap_subset)
head(gap_subset)

```

💡If you want to learn how to use tidyverse in more detail, you can check out D-Lab's [R Data Wrangling and Manipulation](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-Data-Wrangling) workshop series.

### 🥊Challenge 4: Select columns using tidyverse

Use the `select()` function from `tidyverse` to select three variables from the gap data frame. Assign those three variables to a new data frame. Check the dimensions of your new data frame using the `dim()` function.

```{r}




```

## 🎬Next time...

As well as subsetting columns, we can also subset rows. To do this, we use **conditional statements** to tell R which rows we want to return.

🔔 Run the chunk of code below. What do you think we are doing?

```{r}
gap %>%
  filter(year == 2007 | year == 1952) %>%
  select(gdpPercap, lifeExp, continent, year) 

```

## Key Points

-   Many types of data files can be read into R and saved as **data frames**

-   Variables can be different classes (type), common classes are **numeric**, **integers** and **characters**

-   In **base R**, use indexing to subset the data by specifying the rows and columns we want in square brackets

-   In **tidyverse**, use `select()` to select variables
